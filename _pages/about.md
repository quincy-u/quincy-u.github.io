Welcome!

I am a CS PhD student supervised by Shenlong Wang at UIUC. My research focuses on robot learning. 

Before this, I completed my CS bachelor at the University of Toronto, where I was supervised by Prof. Animesh Garg (Now Georgia Tech). In the past, I have been working closely with Prof. Ken Goldberg from UC Berkeley and Xiaolong Wang from UCSD.

My dream is to make intelligent robots integrated into our daily lives.
