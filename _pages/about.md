Welcome!

I completed my Bachelor of Science degree at the University of Toronto, specialist in Computer Science with focus on Artificial Intelligence. My research interests are in robot learning, deep learning, CV and language models.

During my undergraduate studies, I worked with Professor Animesh Garg from University of Toronto (Now Georgia Tech) and Professor Ken GoldBerg from UC Berkeley. After graduation, I worked as a software engineer at Amazon AWS Directory Service team for more than 1 year. Currently I am working with Professor Xiaolong Wang from UCSD. My dream is to make intelligent robots integrated into our daily lives.
